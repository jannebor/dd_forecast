## Extinction Risk of Data Deficient Species

Numerous species of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species are classified as [Data Deficient](https://www.iucnredlist.org/search?permalink=2ed13c01-7e0e-4596-a100-38ed47d30a99). This code was used to predict probabilities of being threatened by extinction for Data Deficient species containing range map data available from the IUCN [spatial data download](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download). The classifier can be applied for individual species using our [web application](https://ml-extinctionrisk.indecol.no/) (alpha version).

Scripts for data pre-processing, e.g., calculating land-use fractions, etc., and stacking all spatial layers are stored in [workflow/preparation/raster_preparation](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/tree/main/workflow/preparation/raster_preparation) and need to be adjusted individually.

The underlying function for retrieving predictor data from tables, web sources (i.e., IUCN, GBIF & OBIS), and the above downloaded spatial datasets for single species is [workflow/preparation/data_extraction.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/preparation/data_extraction.R). We applied this function for entire spatial datasets in [workflow/preparation/data_extraction_batch.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/preparation/data_extraction_batch.R). The resulting full dataframe (df_ml_v2) is stored as R object in [dataframes/full_data](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/tree/main/dataframes/full_data).

## Model preparation

#### Full reproducibility (based on code only) is given from this point onwards:

Training (75%) and testing (25%) data was prepared ([workflow/preparation/model_prep.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/preparation/model_prep.R)) for each partition (partition 1: all species, partition 2: marine & non-marine species separately) and stored as R objects in [dataframes/Partition 1](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/tree/main/dataframes/Partition1) and [dataframes/Partition 2](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/tree/main/dataframes/Partition2). For each of the partition-specific dataframes features were selected ([workflow/preparation/feature_selection.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/preparation/feature_selection.R)) using the Boruta algorithm ([Kursa & Rudnicki 2010](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v036.i11)). Only relevant features were considered during model building.

## Model building

In total 510 models were fitted using [AutoML](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) in H2O. 222 models were fitted using all species ([workflow/training/model_partition 1.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/training/model_partition1.R)), 134 using only marine species and 154 using only non-marine species ([workflow/training/model_partition 2.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/training/model_partition2.R)). All models were calibrated using 10-fold cross-validation, and ranked in terms of AUC based on the set aside testing data (25%), e.g. for partition 1:

| model_id                                 | auc   | logloss | aucpr | mean_per_class_error | rmse  | mse   |
|------------------------------------------|-------|---------|-------|----------------------|-------|-------|
| StackedEnsemble_AllModels_3\_AutoML_1    | 0.912 | 0.314   | 0.795 | 0.174                | 0.311 | 0.097 |
| StackedEnsemble_AllModels_6\_AutoML_1    | 0.912 | 0.315   | 0.795 | 0.175                | 0.311 | 0.097 |
| StackedEnsemble_AllModels_4\_AutoML_1    | 0.912 | 0.315   | 0.795 | 0.175                | 0.311 | 0.097 |
| StackedEnsemble_AllModels_5\_AutoML_1    | 0.910 | 0.318   | 0.791 | 0.176                | 0.313 | 0.098 |
| StackedEnsemble_BestOfFamily_4\_AutoML_1 | 0.909 | 0.318   | 0.793 | 0.184                | 0.313 | 0.098 |

## Model evaluation

Performance metrics were calculated based on the testing data ([workflow/evaluation/model_performance.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/evaluation/model_performance.R)) and based on reclassified Data Deficient species ([workflow/evaluation/dd_performance.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/evaluation/dd_performance.R)). Permutation variable importance was calculated by measuring performance loss before and after a feature was permuted ([workflow/evaluation/variable_importance.R](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/workflow/evaluation/variable_importance.R)).

## Predictions

The generated predictions for Data Deficient species are stored in [dd_predictions.csv](https://github.com/jannebor/dd_forecast/blob/main/dataframes/Partition1/predictions/dd_predictions.csv) and show the probability of being threatened by extinction for each species:

| Species                   | Last Assessed | Taxonomic class | Red List Category | Probability of being threatened |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Chirostoma grandocule     | 2018          | Actinopterygii  | Data Deficient    | 95.8%                           |
| Sarcohyla miahuatlanensis | 2019          | Amphibia        | Data Deficient    | 95.8%                           |

| â€¦                         |               |                 |                   |                                 |
